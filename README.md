# Windows Backup Lab

## Objective
This lab was designed to enhance my understanding of the computer back-up process, especially in relation to Windows machines and the built-in tools provided by the Windows operating system for creating images and performing system restorations. To that end, the lab consisted of backing up my personal Windows machine and then restoring my machine from this newly created backup. Although this lab was relativley simple, effective backup systems are vital in the IT world. They provide a large degree of protection against ransomware, system defects, and even catastrophic failures, and can be the difference between success and failure in meeting SLA requirements. This lab was used to build my understanding of this process, and will be used as a foundation to advance into more complicated backup tools like Veeam. 

### Skills Learned

- Developed a hands-on understanding of creating a Windows image and restoring from this image
- Strengthened ability to respond to both cybersecurity events, such as ransomware incidents, as well as general system failures
